# Time Complexity

### Agenda (21-03-2025)
- No. of iterations
- Big O Notations

> `[]-inclusive ; ()-exclusive`

> How many numbers are there in [3, 10]?
    b-a+1
    10-3+1 = 7+1 = 8

THUS TO SOLVE -

[ ] -> b-a+1

( ) -> b-a-1

[ ) -> b-a

## Arithmetic Progression:

(a+0*d) , (a+1*d) , (a+2*d) , (a+3*d) ... (a+(n-1)*d)

> Summation of first N terms : (N/2) * [2*a + (N-1) * d]

    - a = Starting Number/Digit/Value.
    - d = Common Difference.

## Geometric Progression:

a*(r) , a*(r)^2 , a*(r)^3 , a*(r)^4 ... a*(r)^(n-1)

> Summation of first N terms : a * ((r^N) -1)/r-1

    - a = Starting Starting Number/Digit/Value.
    - r = d = Common Ratio (multiple to get next number).
