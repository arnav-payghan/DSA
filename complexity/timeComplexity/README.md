# Time Complexity

### Agenda (21-03-2025)
- No. of iterations
- Big O Notations

> `[]-inclusive ; ()-exclusive`

> How many numbers are there in [3, 10]?
    b-a+1
    10-3+1 = 7+1 = 8

THUS TO SOLVE -
[] -> b-a+1
() -> b-a-1
[) -> b-a

## Arithmetic Progression:
(a+0*d) , (a+1*d) , (a+2*d) , (a+3*d) , (a+(n-1)*d)
- Summation of first N terms : (N/2) * [2*a + (N-1) * d]
    - a = Starting Number/Digit/Value.
    - d = Common Difference.
